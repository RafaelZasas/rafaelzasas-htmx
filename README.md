# Personal Website (again)

This is the 4th (or maybe 5th idk) iteration of my Personal Website.

I decided to go all the way back to basics for this iteration. The plan is to use as little javascript as possible and using web infrastructure the way it was intented to be used.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Raw Dog HTML, HTMX, TailwindCSS.

**Server:** Golang, with the html/template package for template generation.

## Features

- Fancy UI
- Blog
- Admin Dashboard (Which you will never see)
- Full role based authentication (Which you will most likely never benefit from)
- Cool AF

## Roadmap

- Make the blog better

- Not sure I'll figure it out later
